Enhance Ducky Debug with proactive approach and improved functionality

  This commit enhances the Ducky Debug functionality by:

  1. Updating CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.md.vision to reflect a more proactive approach to debugging
     - The feature now triggers not just on explicit requests but whenever debugging is needed
     - Added clearer guidance on when to use this capability

  2. Improving the ducky_debug.py script with:
     - Support for log files and expected behavior description
     - More detailed system prompts with structured output format
     - Detailed analysis option for complex problems
     - Better error handling and reporting
     - Extended command-line options

  3. Updating tests to work with the enhanced implementation

  This enhancement allows Claude Code to assist with debugging more effectively, without requiring explicit commands from the user.
