# Clauducky

**Clauducky** is a **portable toolkit** for AI-assisted development workflows, especially when used with [**Claude Code**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) â€” Anthropic's agentic coding assistant that runs in your terminal.

---

## Overview

Clauducky is a **process-oriented toolkit** that enhances Claude Code's capabilities while guiding it through methodical software development workflows. It provides specialized scripts and processes that benefit both participants:

**For Human Developers**, Clauducky:
- Reduces cognitive load by automating routine tasks
- Enforces good development practices automatically
- Maintains project stability with verified commits
- Eliminates manual work of managing logs and context
- Preserves context across sessions and `/compact` commands

**For Claude Code**, Clauducky:
- Provides clear workflow guidelines and process checkpoints
- Gives access to external resources via specialized scripts
- Structures debugging and research methodologies
- Helps maintain context across sessions
- Prevents common workflow errors

Current capabilities include:
- **Research** via external LLMs with specialized domain knowledge
- **Methodical debugging** using structured "rubber duck" techniques
- **Context preservation** across sessions and `/compact` commands
- **Safe git workflows** with verification and backup mechanisms
- **Console logging** for browser-based applications

Clauducky slows down the process in strategic ways ("you have to slow down to go faster") to achieve better results, fewer regressions, and more predictable outcomesâ€”all while freeing human developers to focus on vision and creativity rather than process management.

## Current Status (Phase 2 In Progress)

Clauducky has completed Phase 1 and is actively developing Phase 2 features. Currently available:

1. **Methodical Development Workflow** defined in `CLAUDE.md` that guides Claude Code through a process of making changes, testing, verification, and commits.

2. **Core Python Scripts**:
   - `research.py`: Connect to external LLMs for specialized knowledge and research
   - `ducky_debug.py`: Structured "rubber duck" debugging with methodical problem analysis
   - `init.py`: Context preservation across sessions and `/compact` commands
   - `git_safe.py`: Safe git workflows with verification, backups, and tagging

3. **Browser Logging Tools**:
   - JavaScript tools for capturing and analyzing browser console output
   - Streamlined reporting of front-end issues to Claude Code

4. **Process Enforcement**:
   - Development workflow process with clear checkpoints
   - Git safety mechanisms to prevent unverified commits
   - Session state tracking to maintain context

Features still on our roadmap include screenshot analysis, advanced debugging tools, and more (see `ROADMAP.md` for details).

## Quick Start

There are two ways to use Clauducky: either install individual scripts into your project, or clone the entire repository for a self-contained experience.

### Method 1: Clone the Complete Repository (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repo in your project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subcreation/clauducky
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./clauducky/scripts/setup_clauducky.sh
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Create a virtual environment in the clauducky directory
   - Install all required dependencies
   - Create a .env file from the template
   - Set up the logs directory

3. **Edit your API keys**:
   ```bash
   # Edit the .env file with your API keys
   nano clauducky/.env
   ```

4. **Initialize with Claude Code**:
   In Claude Code, run:
   ```bash
   source clauducky/venv/bin/activate && python3 clauducky/scripts/python/init.py
   ```

Claude Code will now be aware of all Clauducky capabilities and the recommended workflow.

### Method 2: Use as a Git Submodule

1. **Add Clauducky as a submodule**:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/subcreation/clauducky.git
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./clauducky/scripts/setup_clauducky.sh
   ```

3. **Edit your API keys**:
   ```bash
   # Edit the .env file with your API keys
   nano clauducky/.env
   ```

4. **Initialize with Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   source clauducky/venv/bin/activate && python3 clauducky/scripts/python/init.py
   ```

> **Note**: When using as a submodule, all log files are stored in the `clauducky/logs/` directory, making Clauducky self-contained.

### Method 3: Individual Script Installation

1. **Copy the scripts you need**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p scripts/python scripts/js
   cp clauducky/scripts/python/research.py scripts/python/
   cp clauducky/scripts/python/ducky_debug.py scripts/python/
   cp clauducky/scripts/python/init.py scripts/python/
   cp clauducky/scripts/python/git_safe.py scripts/python/
   cp clauducky/scripts/python/env_loader.py scripts/python/
   
   # Optional: Copy JavaScript logging tools
   cp clauducky/scripts/js/console-logger.js scripts/js/
   cp clauducky/scripts/js/log-server.js scripts/js/
   ```

2. **Copy CLAUDE.md to your project root**:
   ```bash
   cp clauducky/CLAUDE.md ./
   ```

3. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   cp clauducky/.env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r clauducky/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize with Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/python/init.py
   ```

### Using Clauducky with Claude Code

Once initialized, Claude Code will guide you through the development workflow:

1. Implementing changes
2. Testing and verifying
3. Reviewing changes
4. Making validated commits

Key commands for Claude Code:
```bash
# Research a topic
source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/python/research.py "Your research query"

# Methodical debugging
source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/python/ducky_debug.py --interactive

# Reinitialize after /compact
source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/python/init.py

# Safe git commits
source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/python/git_safe.py commit -m "Your commit message" --verified --force
```

For detailed usage instructions, see the [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) file.

## Philosophy & Best Practices

Clauducky embodies several key principles for productive AI-assisted development:

- **Process Over Speed**: Following methodical processes leads to fewer regressions and better outcomes. As with learning any skill, "you have to slow down to go faster."

- **Dual-Participant Design**: Clauducky is designed with both human developers and AI assistants in mind, optimizing the experience for both participants.

- **Guided Workflow**: Rather than leaving process management to chance, Clauducky provides clear checkpoints and verification steps.

- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining shared understanding between sessions is critical for continuity and building on previous work.

- **Verification First**: Changes should be tested and verified before being committed, preserving project stability.

- **Continuous Documentation**: Keeping documentation updated alongside code changes ensures everyone understands the evolving system.

We view AI assistants as accelerators for human creativityâ€”not replacements for human judgment. Clauducky helps both humans and AI assistants work together more effectively by providing structure, tools, and processes that complement their respective strengths.
