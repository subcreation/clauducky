Enhance Ducky Debug with structured rubber duck methodology

  This comprehensive update transforms the debugging functionality to correctly implement the rubber duck debugging methodology:

  1. Restructured approach to focus on methodical problem explanation:
     - Added interactive template-guided mode for structured debugging
     - Created template with sections for expected behavior, evidence, hypotheses
     - Support for saving, loading, and sharing debugging sessions

  2. Implemented dual-purpose interaction model:
     - Primary role: Guide methodical explanation to reveal insights
     - Secondary role: Provide fresh perspective as an outside observer
     - Enhanced prompts to question assumptions and identify blind spots

  3. Technical improvements:
     - Proper virtual environment integration
     - Multiple input modes (interactive, template file, quick mode)
     - Support for including code files, logs, and other evidence
     - Improved model selection based on problem complexity
     - Compare feature to get insights from multiple models

  4. Updated documentation:
     - Clarified true purpose in CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.md.vision
     - Updated ROADMAP.md to reflect current status and future plans
     - Added comprehensive usage examples and options

  This update aligns the debugging functionality with its true purpose - not just getting advice but facilitating a structured process where the
  solution often emerges from the methodical explanation itself.
