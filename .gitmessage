The changes implement a comprehensive console logging system for Clauducky with:

  1. Client-side console logger with event markers and session management
  2. Node.js log server for collecting and saving logs
  3. Utility scripts for analyzing and cleaning logs
  4. Updated CLAUDE.md documentation with usage examples

  This builds upon the concept from thought-tree-prototype but makes it more flexible for general use cases.
