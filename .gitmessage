Here's a summary of the changes we've made:

  1. Major changes:
    - Removed smart_research.py script completely
    - Updated CLAUDE.md to focus on research.py as the primary approach
    - Simplified the workflow to let Claude Code use its intelligence for model selection
    - Updated ROADMAP.md and docs/USAGE.md for consistency
  2. Terminology refinement:
    - Replaced "Get a second opinion" with more research-focused phrases
    - Added natural language triggers like "Look up X online", "Search for information on X", "Check the docs...", "Finding working code examples
  for..."
    - Embraced Claude's natural language understanding rather than restricting to rigid commands
    - Focused on reducing cognitive load for human users by allowing varied phrasings

  These changes make Clauducky more intuitive to use with natural language while simplifying the implementation. The approach leverages Claude's
  intelligence for both understanding user intent and selecting appropriate models for research tasks.
