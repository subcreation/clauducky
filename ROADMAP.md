### Goals
- Create foundational Python scripts for research and debugging
- Establish basic project structure and documentation

### Deliverables
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] README.md with project overview
- [x] CLAUDE.md with current abilities definition
- [x] External Research Script
  - [x] Robust research script (`research.py`)
  - [x] Connect to external LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic)
  - [x] Pass queries and receive responses
  - [x] Format responses for Claude Code consumption
- [✓] Initial Ducky Debug Script (`ducky_debug.py`)
  - [✓] Accept problem descriptions and code snippets
  - [✓] Support for log files and expected behavior
  - [✓] Auto-select models based on problem complexity
  - [✓] Support multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- [x] Basic tests to verify script functionality
  - [x] Unit tests for research script
  - [x] Unit tests for ducky_debug script

## Phase 2: Context Preservation and Process Enforcement
**Status: In Progress**

### Goals
- Address issues with context preservation after `/compact` commands
- Improve process enforcement and methodology adherence
- Implement safer git workflows for Claude Code
- Create initialization scripts for session management

### Deliverables
- [x] Context Preservation
  - [x] Create initialization script (`init.py`) to restore context after `/compact`
  - [x] Session state tracking with timestamps
  - [ ] Automatic detection of context loss
  - [ ] Interactive reorientation process

- [ ] Git Workflow Safety (Priority)
  - [ ] Create commit verification system
    - [ ] Show diffs and require approval before committing
    - [ ] Distinguish between verified/tested commits and experimental code
    - [ ] Add commit tags for verified working states
  - [ ] Implement safer commit message templates
    - [ ] Add Clauducky attribution alongside Claude Code
    - [ ] Option to suppress AI attribution for privacy
  - [ ] Create "prepare commit" mode for user-managed git operations
  - [ ] Implement automatic git backups before major changes
  - [ ] Add clean working directory enforcement

- [ ] Enhanced Ducky Debug Workflow
  - [ ] Revise ducky_debug.py with structured debugging framework:
    - [ ] Create template/form for methodically documenting the problem
    - [ ] Add sections for expected behavior, actual behavior, evidence
    - [ ] Include prompts for listing already-tried solutions
    - [ ] Build checklist to ensure methodical debugging steps
  - [ ] Enhance interaction model for dual purpose:
    - [ ] Primary role: Serve as listener/collaborator during problem explanation process
    - [ ] Secondary role: Fresh outside perspective with potential breakthrough insights
    - [ ] Design prompts that specifically encourage questioning assumptions
    - [ ] Instruct model to evaluate if we're solving the right problem
    - [ ] Ensure complete relevant code context is provided for external review
    - [ ] Default to highest-capability models when progress stalls
    - [ ] Add automatic escalation to more powerful models after failed attempts
    - [ ] Create clear mechanism for suggesting research paths when knowledge gaps identified
    - [ ] Add option to iterate on explanations when clarification needed
  - [ ] Integration with existing tools:
    - [ ] Import and adapt console logging from thought-tree-prototype
    - [ ] Create mechanism to include snippets of logs in explanation
    - [ ] Support attaching screenshots/visuals to debugging context

- [ ] Research Script Improvements
  - [ ] Rename `research.py` to `search.py` for clarity and simplicity
  - [ ] Support both in-depth research and quick searches in a unified approach
  - [ ] Streamline usage with clearer command-line arguments

### Timeline
- Target completion: End of Q2 2025

## Potential Future Enhancement: "Enhanced Ducky Research"

**Rationale**: We've considered a more advanced approach to `research.py` that would go beyond a single query/response cycle. This could include:

1. **Iterative Querying**  
   - The script automatically performs multiple searches, refining each new query based on the previous result.

2. **Structured Thinking / Checklists**  
   - Before calling any external LLM, Claude Code follows a methodical checklist (e.g., identifying the core knowledge gap, clarifying search goals). 
   - This ensures we "rubber-duck" the research question thoroughly, potentially solving the issue without external calls.

3. **User Intervention Points**  
   - As the script refines its questions, it could prompt the developer for confirmation or additional details before continuing. 
   - This helps prevent runaway searches or wasted API calls.

4. **Smarter Model Selection**  
   - If needed, we may create a robust (and genuinely "smart") logic to pick a model—possibly involving a search-enabled LLM or an up-to-date local reference. 
   - This would require ongoing maintenance and might not be necessary if Claude Code itself can already make good decisions.

**When**: We'll evaluate the effectiveness of our current `research.py` approach during real projects. If we discover repeated shortcomings—like shallow queries, unnecessary costs, or incomplete info—we'll revisit these ideas.
