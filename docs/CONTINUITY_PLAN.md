# Clauducky Continuity Plan

This document outlines our strategy for addressing issues with Claude Code's context retention, process adherence, and methodology enforcement.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Context Preservation Issues**
   - Claude Code loses context after using `/compact`
   - CLAUDE.md alone isn't sufficient for reorientation

2. **Process Enforcement Problems**
   - Claude Code doesn't consistently follow the methodology
   - No mechanisms to ensure proper usage of scripts

3. **Git Management**
   - Inconsistent saving of changes
   - Inability to revert to functional states

4. **Script Design Limitations**
   - Current scripts don't guide Claude Code step-by-step
   - Relies too much on Claude Code's initiative to follow instructions

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Create an Initialization/Reorientation Script

```python
# clauducky_init.py
def initialize_session():
    """Script to run at the beginning of sessions or after /compact"""
    print("CLAUDE CODE ORIENTATION SESSION - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY")
    print("Loading Clauducky methodology and guidelines...")
    
    # Load and display core guidelines
    with open("CLAUDE.md", "r") as f:
        core_guidelines = f.read()
        print(core_guidelines)
    
    # Force acknowledgment
    print("\nIMPORTANT: Please confirm you've read and understood these guidelines.")
    print("Type 'confirm' to continue:")
    # In a real implementation, we'd check for confirmation
    
    # Save session state
    with open(".clauducky_session", "w") as f:
        f.write("initialized=true\n")
        f.write(f"timestamp={datetime.now().isoformat()}\n")
```

This script would be run:
- At the start of every session
- After detecting a `/compact` command (through user prompting)
- When Claude Code seems to be deviating from methodology

### 2. Convert Ducky Debug to an Interactive Process

Redesign `ducky_debug.py` to be a highly interactive script that guides Claude Code step-by-step:

```python
# Interactive ducky_debug.py concept
def run_interactive_debug():
    print("DUCKY DEBUG INTERACTIVE SESSION")
    
    # Step 1: Define the problem
    problem = input("What problem are you debugging? ")
    
    # Step 2: Expected behavior
    expected = input("What was the expected behavior? ")
    
    # Step 3: Actual behavior
    actual = input("What is the actual behavior? ")
    
    # Step 4: Code context
    code = input("Provide relevant code snippets: ")
    
    # Step 5: Problem analysis
    analysis = input("Analyze the potential causes: ")
    
    # Step 6: Create comprehensive query
    query = f"""
    PROBLEM: {problem}
    
    EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
    {expected}
    
    ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
    {actual}
    
    CODE CONTEXT:
    {code}
    
    ANALYSIS:
    {analysis}
    """
    
    # Step 7: Submit to external model for independent perspective
    external_response = submit_to_external_model(query)
    
    # Step 8: Present results
    print("\nEXTERNAL ANALYSIS:")
    print(external_response)
    
    # Step 9: Prompt for action plan
    action_plan = input("Based on this analysis, what's your action plan? ")
    
    # Step 10: Save session
    save_debug_session(problem, expected, actual, code, analysis, external_response, action_plan)
```

This forces Claude Code to go through each step methodically before proceeding.

### 3. Implement Git Safety Mechanisms

Create a script that enforces careful git management:

```python
# safe_git.py
def commit_changes(commit_message):
    """Safely commit changes with verification"""
    # Step 1: Show what's changing
    print("Changes to be committed:")
    os.system("git diff --staged")
    
    # Step 2: Force verification
    verification = input("Are you sure these changes are correct? (yes/no): ")
    if verification.lower() != "yes":
        print("Commit cancelled.")
        return
    
    # Step 3: Create incremental backup
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    backup_branch = f"backup_{timestamp}"
    os.system(f"git checkout -b {backup_branch}")
    os.system("git add .")
    os.system(f"git commit -m 'Backup before {commit_message}'")
    os.system("git checkout main")
    
    # Step 4: Make the actual commit
    os.system(f"git commit -m '{commit_message}'")
    
    print(f"Changes committed. Backup available at branch: {backup_branch}")
```

This would:
- Require explicit verification before commits
- Create automatic backup branches
- Ensure proper documentation of changes

### 4. Create a Documentation Generator

Build a script that generates comprehensive documentation for any changes:

```python
# document_changes.py
def document_changes():
    """Generate documentation for recent changes"""
    # Get git diff
    diff = os.popen("git diff HEAD~1").read()
    
    # Analyze changes
    changes = analyze_code_changes(diff)
    
    # Generate documentation template
    template = f"""
    # Changes Documentation
    
    ## Summary
    [Summarize the changes made]
    
    ## Files Changed
    {changes['files_changed']}
    
    ## Implementation Details
    [Describe implementation details]
    
    ## Testing Performed
    [Describe testing performed]
    
    ## Potential Impacts
    [Describe potential impacts]
    """
    
    # Save to documentation file
    with open("CHANGES.md", "w") as f:
        f.write(template)
    
    print("Documentation template generated. Please complete it.")
```

This enforces careful documentation of all changes, helping Claude Code understand what it's modifying.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (1-2 weeks)
1. Enhance scripts to be more interactive and step-by-step
2. Add clear checkpoint validation at each stage
3. Create initialization script for orientation/reorientation

### Phase 2: Process Enforcement (2-3 weeks)
1. Create git safety mechanisms
2. Build documentation generators
3. Implement "tiny steps" methodology enforcers

### Phase 3: Evaluation and Refinement (ongoing)
1. Test with real debugging scenarios
2. Gather feedback on effectiveness
3. Refine approaches based on actual usage

## Documentation Updates

We should update CLAUDE.md with specific instructions about:
1. When and how to reinitialize the session after `/compact`
2. Critical warnings about making small, incremental changes
3. Explicit requirements for script usage
